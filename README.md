# Hexxxx's NT Bot
Hexxxx's NT Bot is a simple Nitro Type bot written in Python, using selenium and chromedriver. Brought to you by impeccable distaste towards the ongoing neglegence of the NT development team and unsufficient anti-cheat measures. A project to test NT's bot detection, will probably be abused for cheating, but there are already better bots written in JavaScript anyways.

## Requirements
The following system requirements must be met to run Hexxxx's NT Bot:

- Windows (Linux is possible, but not tested nor built / released.)
- US keyboard layout (required by chromedriver; see installation through Windows language settings)
- Chrome browser
- NitroType account

## Tutorial
TODO: Add tutorial. :(

## Current features
- Automated login
- Automated racing
- randomized wpm & accuracy to evade simple anti-cheat methods

## Planned features
- Automated account creation
- Multiple parallel sessions in same instance
- Better randomization and actual anti-detection strategies
- Headless mode
- Automated testing & less bugs :)

## Not planned / missing features (for now)
- Captcha / human verification
